IP Information
SSL Chain Analysis
DNS Records Retrieval
Cookie Management
Crawl Rules Configuration
HTTP Headers Analysis
Quality Metrics Assessment
Server Location Information
Associated Hosts Identification
Redirect Chain Inspection
TXT Records Retrieval
Server Status Monitoring
Open Ports Scanning
Traceroute Execution
Carbon Footprint Estimation
Server Information Gathering
Whois Lookup
Domain Information Retrieval
DNS Security Extensions Check
Website Features Analysis
HTTP Strict Transport Security Inspection
DNS Server Identification
Tech Stack Analysis
Listed Pages Retrieval
security.txt Inspection
Linked Pages Extraction
Social Tags Analysis
Email Configuration Check
Firewall Detection
HTTP Security Features Analysis
Archive History Retrieval
Global Ranking Information
Block Detection
Malware & Phishing Detection
TLS Cipher Suites Analysis
TLS Security Configuration Check
TLS Handshake Simulation
Screenshot Capture
To create this tool, follow the steps below:

Step 1: Define the CLI interface using a library such as argparse or click.
Step 2: Implement each functionality as a separate command within the CLI tool.
Step 3: Use appropriate libraries and tools for each functionality:

IP Information: requests, ipinfo
SSL Chain Analysis: ssl, cryptography
DNS Records Retrieval: dnspython
Cookie Management: http.cookies
HTTP Headers Analysis: requests
Traceroute Execution: subprocess, scapy
Whois Lookup: whois
etc.
Step 4: Ensure that the tool output is clear and concise, leveraging formatters such as json, xml, or table.

Step 5: Provide usage examples for each command in the toolâ€™s documentation.

Step 6: Test the tool thoroughly across various environments and scenarios to ensure reliability and accuracy.

Step 7: Package the tool for easy installation via a package manager like pip.

Here is an example CLI structure for the tool:

multi-tool:
  ipinfo [IP]              - Get information about an IP address
  sslchain [DOMAIN]        - Analyze the SSL chain for a domain
  dnsrecords [DOMAIN]      - Retrieve DNS records for a domain
  cookies [URL]            - Manage cookies for a URL
  crawlrules [SETTINGS]    - Configure crawl rules
  headers [URL]            - Analyze HTTP headers for a URL
  qualitymetrics [URL]     - Assess quality metrics for a website
  serverlocation [DOMAIN]  - Get server location information
  associatedhosts [DOMAIN] - Identify associated hosts
  redirectchain [URL]      - Inspect the redirect chain for a URL
  ...
Please implement the tool according to the guidelines above.
