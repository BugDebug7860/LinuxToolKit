Your task is to provide detailed descriptions for new features to be implemented in a security scanning tool.

The following features have been outlined and need detailed descriptions:

1. **Vulnerability Scanning Tool**: 
   Implement a feature that scans the target for known vulnerabilities using Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entries. This tool should be able to: 
   * Identify CVE entries based on the target's software and configurations.
   * Provide detailed reports on discovered vulnerabilities, including severity and potential impact.
   * Suggest remediation measures based on the CVE database.

2. **Rate Limiting Checker**: 
   Create a function that tests how the server handles rapid requests to identify potential rate limiting issues. This function should:
   * Simulate multiple rapid requests to the server to observe behavior.
   * Detect if the server implements rate limiting measures and identify thresholds.
   * Provide recommendations for improving rate limiting configurations.

3. **Socket Scanner**: 
   Develop a tool that checks for open sockets on the server to assess potential service exposure. This tool should:
   * Scan for open ports and sockets on the target server.
   * Identify services running on detected sockets and assess their security.
   * Report on potential exposures and suggest corrective measures.

4. **Header Analyzer**: 
   Enhance the current HTTP header analysis to include detailed security headers, such as Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, etc. The enhanced analyzer should:
   * Review HTTP headers to detect the presence and configuration of security-related headers.
   * Provide insights into header effectiveness and potential security gaps.
   * Recommend improvements for header configurations to bolster security.

5. **Domain Health Checker**: 
   Implement a tool to analyze domain registration, including expiry dates and registrar info. This tool should:
   * Retrieve domain registration details, including registrar and expiry dates.
   * Analyze domain health and provide alerts for upcoming renewals.
   * Offer advice on maintaining domain health and security.

6. **SSL Configuration Checker**: 
   Extend the SSL analysis to check for weak ciphers and outdated SSL/TLS versions. This tool should:
   * Inspect SSL/TLS configurations for the presence of weak ciphers.
   * Verify the use of up-to-date SSL/TLS versions.
   * Report on vulnerabilities and suggest enhancements to SSL configurations.

Please provide detailed descriptions for the features mentioned above, ensuring each feature is comprehensive and actionable.
